# VoC-Analyser
VoC Analyser deploys LLMs to segment and tag unstructured qualitative customer feedback. The structured and tagged data is visualised in charts and graphs, enabling product managers to answer critical questions about the strategy & roadmap.

# Vision

# Strategy; unique value focus
VoC Analyser focuses intensely on the creation and maintenance of a global **_taxonomy_** for your product based on structured **evaluations** of the LLMs output.

Aimed at B2B companies with less data and more complex products, VoC Analyser realises that LLMs can't generate useful aggregations out-the-box. LLMs improve with more context and guidance (e.g., a comprehensive taxonomy); but that context can be arduous to maintain. Existing solutions don't provide the infrastructure and automation around the _context_ that is essential for the target workflow – automated labelling – to be valuable. 

VoC Analyser presents multiple tools to manage context at scale, driving greater accuracy over time. More than this, it utilises AI to evaluate itself and iterate on the taxonomy itself. Just by processing more data, VoC Analyser automatically becomes more accurate by refining your core Taxonomy.

# Jobs to be Done
1. When I'm making decisions about what to prioritise in and around sprint planning...
	a. I need to review data blah blah
	b. And I face such and such challenges
  c. I wish for these potential gains

2. When I'm refining a feature (e.g. ideating) with my team,
	a. I need to share discovered knowledge about the customer JtbD and expectations for the feature
	b. But that data is "locked" in call recordings and messages that I can't search through easily
