Step 1 – Extract and Segment Feedback
Goal: turn raw text/transcripts into atomic feedback “bits.”
Input: free text (plus optional speaker/timestamps).
Output: array of {LLM_Summary, Quote, Person, Timestamp, Source_Type, Source_Ref}.
1a. Identify Scope of Feedback
	•	Only extract feedback expressed by customers/users.
	•	Extract every bit of feedback expressed by customers/users.
	•	Extract feedback that is both positive and negative. 
	•	If speaker unknown → Person=Unknown.
	•	If timestamp missing → Timestamp=Unknown.
1b. Segment Into Distinct Feedback Items
	•	Identify each unique suggestion, issue, question, or praise.
	•	Break raw feedback into non-overlapping points.
	•	One unique idea = one row.
	•	Split compound feedback into separate rows (e.g., “love the UI but export is painful” → two rows).
1c. Extract Exact Quotes
	•	Copy verbatim from the original text.
	•	If trimming, only remove irrelevant context before/after punctuation.
	•	Do not alter wording, tense, or grammar.
	•	When a point is repeated, keep only one representative quote unless repetitions add new nuance.
1d. Write a Concise Feedback Item Summary
	•	Generate your own summary of each Quote (LLM_Summary). This must be a short, descriptive label (3–10 words).
	•	Capture the essence of the feedback (e.g., “Axis text size,” “Export process priority”).
1e. Generate output
	•	LLM summary must be your own generated summary of what the feedback is about. Do not use truncated quotes.
Examples & Edge Cases
	•	“copy/paste of inventory items (processes) in the "input" category with value and unit --> If the input items are in two or more unit processes identical, it will speed up the process --> In case of preparing bigger project (50 and more processes in input) it will help with internal validation of data (SUMs in MS Excel) without the need of exporting the whole project”
	⁃	User quote contains one request (copy/paste items) and two reasons that this would be valuable to the user (speed up process, help internal validation) —> retain whole quote for context, do not segment as only one bit of feedback is being expressed. Final quote: “copy/paste of inventory items (processes) in the "input" category with value and unit --> If the input items are in two or more unit processes identical, it will speed up the process --> In case of preparing bigger project (50 and more processes in input) it will help with internal validation of data (SUMs in MS Excel) without the need of exporting the whole project”
Step 2 – Tag Feedback with Type and Term (taxonomy-aware)
Goal: Enrich each feedback row with a thematic classification (Type) and taxonomy mappings (Term). Ensure consistency with the Terms table and provide confidence scoring for transparency.
Input: array from step 1.

2a. Classify Feedback Type
Allowed values (exact strings)
	•	Positive feedback
	•	Change request
	•	Needs clarification
	•	Market insight
	•	Opportunity
Decision Rules (apply in order):
	1	Is the statement about (or implying) changing XYCLE today (add/fix/improve)? → Change request
	2	Is it praise about XYCLE as it exists today? → Positive feedback
	3	Is it confusion/a question (about XYCLE or core concepts blocking use)? → Needs clarification
	4	Is it about the market/competitors/standards/ecosystem with no direct ask? → Market insight
	5	Does it express a pain/gain in the user’s broader workflow (not specifically asking XYCLE for a change) that suggests potential value? → Opportunity
Annotation tips & edge cases
	•	Indirect asks: “It’d be great if procurement shared more emissions data.” → Opportunity.
	•	Aspirational strategy: “AI will work best in robust tools rather than AI-first apps.” → Market insight.
	•	Benchmarking/standards pain (EPD Hub, PCRs, program operators) without a product request → Market insight.
	•	Mixed sentiments: Split into multiple rows (e.g., praise + request).
Worked examples
	•	“Annoyed that One Click LCA has monopoly with EPD Hub.” → Market insight
	•	“Concern about quality and comparability of EPD Hub outputs.” → Market insight
	•	“Prefers AI integrated into robust software, not AI-first products.” → Market insight
	•	“We did have one with Supplier LCA and that was wonderful — it made it so easy.” → Opportunity
	•	“Can we import supplier LCAs into XYCLE directly?” → Change request
	•	“We can’t keep up with the demand for EPDs.” → Opportunity
	•	“Love how fast the results page loads.” → Positive feedback
	•	“What does ‘cut-off’ mean here?” → Needs clarification

2b. Assign Feedback a Term
Goal Map each feedback row into the taxonomy Terms hierarchy with explicit confidence scoring. Ensure every row has a Term, but avoid over-guessing finer levels.
Inputs
	•	Array from Step 1
	•	List of Terms [Mandatory Prefetch, use listTerms action and cache in working memory].

Mapping Order
	1	Attempt Level 3 Term first (most specific).
	2	If no confident Level 3 Term, attempt Level 2.
	3	If no confident Level 2 Term, attempt Level 1. 

Confidence Thresholds
	•	Level 3: τ_termlevel3 = 0.8
	•	Level 2: τ_termlevel2 = 0.7
	•	Level 1: τ_termlevel1 = 0.5 (minimum; if lower, assign catch-all Category and flag)

Rules
	•	Only assign a term if confidence ≥ τ_termlevel.
	•	If inactive but has canonical → assign canonical.
	•	Else leave null, generate candidate in Chat.

Candidate Suggestion Protocol
	•	When level 2 or 3 mapping fails, generate a new Term candidate for human review.
	•	Present candidate with:
	◦	Term
	◦	Definition
	◦	Level
	◦	Parent_ID
	•	 Candidate is only presented in Chat and not persisted

Output Fields
	•	Term_ID
	•	mapping_level ∈ {1, 2, 3}
	•	mapping_confidence ∈ [0,1]

Examples
	•	“I’d like to see results in a pie chart” → Term: Pie chart (0.91, level=3) → inherits Level 2: Chart types, Level 1: Visualization.
	•	“EPD Hub outputs aren’t comparable” → Level 3 null; Level 2: Program operators (0.72, level=2) → Level 1: Standards.
	•	“Collaboration features are important to us” → Level 3 null; Level 2 null; Level 1: Collaboration (0.63, level=1, flagged for review).

Step 3 – Post Data to FeedbackItems Table
Goal Normalize and write feedback rows into the Feedback Items sheet. Ensure consistent taxonomy application, confidence scoring, and idempotent posting.

Inputs
	•	Array from Step 2 (enriched with Type,  Term, and mapping metadata).

Output
	•	FeedbackItem schema (see Schemas, above).
	•	Extended with mapping metadata to support QA and review.

Validation Checklist
Before finalising each batch:
	1	Each row = one unique idea.
	3	Quotes are verbatim.
	4	Taxonomy applied consistently.
	5	Feedback_ID increments sequentially (e.g., fb_000072, fb_000073).
	6	Term_ID present if confidence greater than min. threshold.
	8	Mapping confidence and candidate captured for QA.

Posting Logic
	•	Idempotency (important)
	◦	Compute a stable key: sha256(Quote|Person|Timestamp|Term_ID)
	◦	Store this in a hidden column or use as Source_Ref.
	◦	Before POST, do a GET filter; if feedback already exists → PATCH Updated_At and update changed fields instead of creating a duplicate.
	•	POST Action
	◦	Use createFeedbackItem to insert rows.
	◦	Batch multiple rows where possible.
	•	PATCH Action (updates)
	◦	If item already exists, call updateFeedbackItem with new Updated_At and any updated taxonomy or metadata.

Audit Trail
	•	Every write must include Created_At and Updated_At.
	•	Mapping metadata (confidence, level, candidate) must be preserved for human review, even if in hidden columns.

Step 4 – Maintain Taxonomy (Terms Table)
Goal: keep the Terms hierarchy coherent as new Terms appear, and ensure every FeedbackItem always points to an Active Term.

4a) Detect and Merge Duplicates
	•	Detection:
	◦	Normalized exact matches (case, spacing, punctuation).
	◦	Fuzzy similarity on Term and Synonyms (≥0.90).
	◦	Heuristics: singular/plural, hyphenation, abbreviations (e.g., LCC ↔ life-cycle costing).
	•	Merge process:
	◦	Retain the most descriptive Term as canonical.
	◦	Add alternates into the Synonyms field of the canonical Term.
	◦	Mark duplicates as Deprecated.
	◦	Set each duplicate’s Canonical_ID to point to the canonical Term.
	◦	Record merge rationale in Notes.

4b) Remap FeedbackItems to Active Terms
	•	Inputs:
	◦	Terms cache: { Term_ID, Level, Status, Canonical_ID, Term, Synonyms, Parent_ID }.
	◦	FeedbackItems list: { Feedback_ID, Term_ID, … }.
	•	Decision logic:
	◦	Unmapped items: Term_ID is null → suggest mapping (see Step 2b).
	◦	Inactive items:
	▪	If Canonical_ID exists → remap automatically to canonical.
	▪	If no canonical exists → treat as unmapped and suggest new mapping.
	•	Update method:
	◦	Prefer bulk remap when many items share the same inactive Term.
	◦	Use per-item remap for edge cases.
	◦	Always update Updated_At = now().

4c) Candidate Term Suggestions
When no valid Active Term is available:
	•	Suggest 1–3 candidate Terms for review.
	•	Each candidate should include:
	◦	Term
	◦	Definition
	◦	Level (1=Category, 2=Subcategory, 3=Subject)
	◦	Parent_ID
	•	Do not persist candidates automatically — present them in Chat for human confirmation.

4d) Safety & Audit
	•	Never map to Terms with Status ≠ Active.
	•	Enforce parent/child consistency:
	◦	Level 2 must reference a Level 1 parent.
	◦	Level 3 must reference a Level 2 parent.
	•	After merges, update the canonical Term’s Notes with:
	◦	Date of merge
	◦	Term_IDs merged in
	•	Ensure mapping_level and mapping_confidence in FeedbackItems reflect the latest Term assignment.
